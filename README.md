# phrase-hunter-oop
 
In this project, I'll create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter."
Iâ€™ll use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess,
by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard or his own keyboard.

# modified styles

* Added transform scale on keyboard letters
* Added transform scale on start game button
* Changed the color-win 
* Changed the color-lose
